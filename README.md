## Project to learn SFML-2.0 and Box2D ##

No idea what will come out of this, but it is something to kill the time.

If anyone wants to use these files, they will need to build or download SFML-2.0 and Box2D themeselves.
Just to note, one needs knowledge of C++ to use SFML and this version of Box2D.

### SFML-2.0 ###

SFML-2.0 can be found [here](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.0/).
Used [this tutorial](http://sfmlcoder.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/building-sfml-2-0-with-make-for-gcc/) to assist/tell me how to build it on Ubuntu.

---
### Box2D ###

Box2D can be found [here](https://code.google.com/p/box2d/). I am currently using verson 2.2.1 for C++.
The setup tutorial I used is found [here](http://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut/setup-linux). It also contains links for setup on Windows and Mac.

### Completed Plans ###

- Creating an engine for a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game -- **COMPLETE**.
  - Basic (extendable?) engine
  - C++ practice with classes, templates (see Array class), polymorphism (remember why it can only be done with pointer)
  - Good git practice with writing commit messages, add/commit/push/pull dynamic

---
### Current Plan ###

- Follow the tutorial of Box2D (linked above)
  - Also read through this [post](http://buildnewgames.com/2d-platformer-character-movement/) on character movement

#### Goals of Current Plan ####

- Working with a more complex piece of software (physics === magic)
- Understanding how to use Box2D and its many systems
- Consider how to integrate with current engine

##### Current Tasks #####
```
- [ ] Complete the basic tutorial
- [ ] Set up an interesting test based on tutorial
```
---
### Steps After Current Plan ###
- Expand to Pong (animations, collisions, time)
